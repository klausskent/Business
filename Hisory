Once upon a time , i met business man who wanted to collaborate with me , and i accepted. We decided together
to work and joint our ideas. The objective was to make a lot money because we are both are ambitious.
But we were both too impatient. I had the smarts but lacked the experience. He lacked the smarts, but had the experience. Our plan was to put our best attributes together to become one strong unit, and that we did accomplish. So much so, that found love and married each other. But today, I sit alone in my cell. I found him colloborting with another man in a way that I did not appreciate and Killed him.
